# Pipelines

CI/CD pipeline definitions and automation scripts.

## What Goes Here

- GitHub Actions workflows
- GitLab CI configurations
- Docker build files
- Deployment scripts
- Automation utilities

## Structure

```
pipelines/
├── github/            # GitHub Actions workflows
├── docker/            # Dockerfiles and compose
├── scripts/           # Automation scripts
└── terraform/         # Infrastructure as code
```

## Guidelines

- Keep pipelines versioned with the code
- Document required secrets and environment variables
- Test pipelines in isolated environments

# Intents

Future work items not yet ready for Festivals.

## What Goes Here

- Raw ideas captured quickly before they're lost
- Feature requests and enhancement proposals
- Bug reports and issues
- Research topics and explorations
- Chores and maintenance tasks

## Lifecycle

Intents progress through status directories:

1. **inbox/** - Captured but not reviewed
2. **active/** - Being enriched with context
3. **ready/** - Sufficiently clear for Festival promotion
4. **done/** - Resolved (promoted, completed, or superseded)
5. **killed/** - Abandoned

## Usage

```bash
# Capture a new intent (fast, sub-second)
camp intent add

# Capture with editor for deep context
camp intent add --edit

# List all intents
camp intent list

# Edit an existing intent
camp intent edit [id]

# Move to a new status
camp intent move [id] active

# Promote to a Festival
camp intent promote [id]
```

## Structure

```
intents/
├── inbox/          # Captured, not reviewed
├── active/         # Being enriched
├── ready/          # Ready for promotion
├── done/           # Resolved
└── killed/         # Abandoned
```

## Intent File Format

Each intent is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
id: 20260119-153412-add-dark-mode
title: Add dark mode toggle
type: feature
status: inbox
created_at: 2026-01-19
---

# Add dark mode toggle

## Description
...
```

## Design Principle

> **Capture should never require commitment.**
> If an idea requires structure before it can be saved, it will be lost.
> The system allows ideas to exist in an unrefined state and earn their complexity later.

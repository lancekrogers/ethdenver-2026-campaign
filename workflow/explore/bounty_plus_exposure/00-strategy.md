# Bounty + Obedience Corp Exposure Strategy

## The Dual Objective

Every project in this directory must serve TWO purposes:

1. **Win bounty money** at ETHDenver 2026
2. **Generate exposure** for Obedience Corp tooling (camp, fest, obey daemon, the platform)

The hackathon is a marketing event disguised as a competition. 1,500+ developers in one room, live-streamed Demo Day, sponsor attention. Building something impressive WITH our tools is the best possible advertisement.

## What Obedience Corp Actually Is

**"AI that does what you want. The way you want it done."**

Obedience Corp builds infrastructure for autonomous companies - hierarchical AI orchestration with deterministic workflows, shared domain knowledge, and provider-agnostic agent teams.

### Core Products to Showcase

| Tool | What It Does | Exposure Angle |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **camp** | Campaign CLI - AI workspace navigation, scaffolding, workflow management | "This is how we organized our entire hackathon project" |
| **fest** | Festival Methodology CLI - goal-oriented project management for AI agent workflows | "This is how we planned and executed our build in 5 days" |
| **obey daemon** | Core daemon service - runs on dev machines, manages AI agent sessions | "Our agents are orchestrated by this" |
| **obey-hub** | Central coordination server | Backend for multi-agent coordination |
| **obey platform** | Full platform monorepo (daemon + hub + festui + protos) | The complete product |

### The Meta-Narrative

The strongest marketing message: **"We built this project using our own tools."** If we build an impressive hackathon entry AND the tools we used to build it are themselves impressive, that's a double win.

- Demo Day: "We built a cross-chain agent swarm in 5 days. Here's the project. And here's the tooling that made it possible."
- Workshop/talk pitch: "How we used AI agent orchestration to build an AI agent project"
- Booth demo: camp + fest managing the hackathon workflow in real-time

## Exposure Vectors at ETHDenver

1. **Demo Day Stage** (Feb 21) - Primary venue. 2 min to show project + tooling.
2. **AI Agent Workshop** (Feb 18-20) - Could present fest/camp as a workshop topic.
3. **Maker Space** - Live coding sessions showing the workflow.
4. **Discord/Spoke** - Remote engagement with documentation generated by tools.
5. **Sponsor Conversations** - Sponsors see how organized/efficient our workflow is.
6. **Other Hackers** - "What tools are you using?" conversations at the venue.

## Evaluation Criteria for Ideas in This Directory

Each idea must score well on BOTH axes:

### Bounty Axis
- Does it target a real bounty with real prize money?
- Is the technical approach sound?
- Will it impress judges?

### Exposure Axis
- Does it naturally showcase camp/fest/obey tooling?
- Is there a "built with Obedience Corp" story?
- Does it demonstrate our unique value prop (hierarchical agent orchestration)?
- Could it lead to follow-up conversations, partnerships, or users?
- Is there a "meta" angle (using AI orchestration tools to build AI projects)?

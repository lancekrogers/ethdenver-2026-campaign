# Explore Directory

## Purpose

This directory is for **exploring ideas, designs, concepts, and research** — not for detailed planning or implementation specs.

Use this space to:
- Brainstorm project ideas and directions
- Explore design concepts and architectural sketches
- Capture research findings, competitive analysis, and ecosystem mapping
- Draft rough prototypes of ideas before committing to a direction

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Detailed implementation plans (use `festivals/` with the fest CLI)
- Task breakdowns, timelines, or execution specs
- Finalized designs or production-ready documentation

## Workflow

Items in the root are **active explorations**. Use the dungeon subdirectories to manage lifecycle:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `dungeon/ready/` | Explored enough, ready to move to planning |
| `dungeon/completed/` | Exploration finished, conclusions drawn |
| `dungeon/archived/` | Preserved but no longer relevant |
| `dungeon/someday/` | Low priority, revisit later |

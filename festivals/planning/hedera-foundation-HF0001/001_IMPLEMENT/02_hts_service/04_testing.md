# Task: Testing and Verification

**Task Number:** <no value> | **Parallel Group:** None | **Dependencies:** All implementation tasks | **Autonomy:** medium

## Objective

Verify all functionality implemented in this sequence works correctly through comprehensive testing.

## Requirements

- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests verify main workflows
- [ ] Manual testing confirms user stories work as expected
- [ ] Error cases are handled correctly
- [ ] Edge cases are addressed

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

```bash
go test ./internal/hedera/... -v -count=1
```

**Verify:**

- [ ] All new/modified code has test coverage
- [ ] Tests are meaningful (not just coverage padding)
- [ ] Test names describe what they verify

### Integration Tests

```bash
go test ./internal/hedera/... -v -run Integration -count=1
```

**Verify:**

- [ ] Components work together correctly
- [ ] External integrations function properly
- [ ] Data flows correctly through the system

### Manual Verification

Walk through each requirement from the sequence:

1. [ ] **Requirement 1**: [Describe manual test steps and expected result]
2. [ ] **Requirement 2**: [Describe manual test steps and expected result]
3. [ ] **Requirement 3**: [Describe manual test steps and expected result]

## Coverage Requirements

- Minimum coverage: 70% for new code

```bash
go test ./internal/hedera/... -coverprofile=coverage.out && go tool cover -func=coverage.out
```

## Error Handling Verification

- [ ] Invalid inputs are rejected gracefully
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Errors don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Recovery paths work correctly

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Manual verification complete
- [ ] Coverage meets requirements
- [ ] Error handling verified
- [ ] No regressions introduced

## Notes

Document any test gaps, flaky tests, or areas needing future attention here.

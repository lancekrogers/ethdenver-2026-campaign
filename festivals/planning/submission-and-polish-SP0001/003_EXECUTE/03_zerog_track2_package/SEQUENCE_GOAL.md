# Sequence Goal: 03_zerog_track2_package

**Sequence:** 03_zerog_track2_package | **Phase:** 003_EXECUTE | **Status:** Pending | **Created:** 2026-02-18T14:00:00-07:00

## Sequence Objective

**Primary Goal:** Polish the agent-inference README with 0G Compute integration focus and gather compute metrics (latency, GPU utilization, cost per inference, throughput) for the 0G Track 2 ($7k) bounty submission.

**Contribution to Phase Goal:** This sequence produces the documentation and evidence package for 0G Track 2, which requires demonstrating decentralized GPU inference. The compute metrics document is the key evidence judges will evaluate.

## Success Criteria

The sequence goal is achieved when:

### Required Deliverables

- [ ] **Polished README.md**: agent-inference README focused on 0G Compute integration, inference pipeline, and decentralized GPU usage with bounty alignment section
- [ ] **Compute Metrics Document**: `docs/compute-metrics.md` with inference latency, GPU utilization, cost per inference, and throughput measurements

### Quality Standards

- [ ] README clearly explains the 0G Compute integration and why decentralized GPU inference matters
- [ ] Compute metrics include raw data, methodology description, and summary statistics
- [ ] All measurements are reproducible with documented methodology
- [ ] Bounty alignment section explicitly maps features to 0G Track 2 requirements

### Completion Criteria

- [ ] All tasks in sequence completed successfully
- [ ] Quality verification tasks passed
- [ ] Code review completed and issues addressed

## Task Alignment

| Task | Task Objective | Contribution to Sequence Goal |
|------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| 01_link_project.md | Unlink previous project, link agent-inference | Enables `fgo` navigation to agent-inference |
| 02_polish_readme.md | Polish agent-inference README | Primary submission document for 0G Track 2 |
| 03_compute_metrics.md | Gather and document compute metrics | Key evidence document for bounty evaluation |
| 04_testing_and_verify.md | Quality gate: testing | Verifies metrics accuracy and documentation quality |
| 05_code_review.md | Quality gate: code review | Reviews documentation and methodology |
| 06_review_results_iterate.md | Quality gate: iterate | Addresses findings and confirms readiness |

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites (from other sequences)

- 01_e2e_testing: Validates that the inference agent runs correctly before metrics collection
- 02_hedera_track3_package: Agent-coordinator README may reference inference agent

### Provides (to other sequences)

- **Compute Metrics**: Referenced by 08_demo_video for demo talking points
- **Polished README**: Used in 0G Track 2 submission form

# Sequence Goal: 06_hedera_track4_package

**Sequence:** 06_hedera_track4_package | **Phase:** 003_EXECUTE | **Status:** Pending | **Created:** 2026-02-18T14:00:00-07:00

## Sequence Objective

**Primary Goal:** Polish the hiero-plugin README and finalize the PR to the Hiero CLI repo for the Hedera Track 4 ($5k) developer tooling bounty submission.

**Contribution to Phase Goal:** This sequence produces the documentation and submission package for Hedera Track 4, which requires developer tooling that extends the Hiero ecosystem. The plugin README and PR are the primary artifacts judges evaluate.

## Success Criteria

The sequence goal is achieved when:

### Required Deliverables

### Quality Standards

- [ ] README includes step-by-step installation instructions
- [ ] Command usage is documented with examples and expected output
- [ ] Templates are showcased with before/after examples
- [ ] PR description follows the target repo's contribution guidelines
- [ ] Screenshots of plugin in action are included

### Completion Criteria

- [ ] All tasks in sequence completed successfully
- [ ] Quality verification tasks passed
- [ ] Code review completed and issues addressed

# Sequence Goal: 01_e2e_testing

**Sequence:** 01_e2e_testing | **Phase:** 003_EXECUTE | **Status:** Pending | **Created:** 2026-02-18T14:00:00-07:00

## Sequence Objective

**Primary Goal:** Run the full economy cycle end-to-end on testnet, test failure recovery scenarios, and validate DeFi agent profitability with documented evidence.

**Contribution to Phase Goal:** This sequence validates that all six projects work together as a complete system before any submission packaging begins. If E2E testing fails, the packaging sequences would produce documentation for a broken system. This must pass first.

## Success Criteria

The sequence goal is achieved when:

### Required Deliverables

- [ ] **Full Cycle Test Log**: Documented run of the complete economy cycle (opportunity detection, task assignment via HCS, inference execution, DeFi trade, HTS payment settlement) with logs, screenshots, and timing
- [ ] **Failure Recovery Report**: Documented test results for agent crash, failed HCS message delivery, failed HTS transfer, and network timeout scenarios
- [ ] **Profitability Report**: N trading cycles documented with total revenue, total costs (gas, fees), and net profit calculation -- required evidence for the Base bounty
- [ ] **All Agents Running**: Coordinator, inference, and defi agents started and communicating via HCS on testnet

### Quality Standards

- [ ] All test scenarios documented with reproduction steps
- [ ] Screenshots or log excerpts provided as evidence for each test
- [ ] No critical failures remaining unresolved
- [ ] Profitability data includes transaction hashes for independent verification

### Completion Criteria

- [ ] All tasks in sequence completed successfully
- [ ] Quality verification tasks passed
- [ ] Code review completed and issues addressed

## Task Alignment

| Task | Task Objective | Contribution to Sequence Goal |
|------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| 01_link_project.md | Link festival to agent-coordinator | Enables `fgo` navigation for all subsequent tasks |
| 02_full_cycle_test.md | Run the complete economy cycle | Validates the entire system works end-to-end |
| 03_failure_recovery.md | Test failure recovery scenarios | Proves system resilience under adverse conditions |
| 04_profitability_validation.md | Validate DeFi profitability | Produces the key evidence for the Base bounty |
| 05_testing_and_verify.md | Quality gate: testing | Verifies all test results are complete and accurate |
| 06_code_review.md | Quality gate: code review | Reviews test methodology and documentation quality |
| 07_review_results_iterate.md | Quality gate: iterate | Addresses findings and confirms readiness |

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites (from other sequences)

- None. This is the first sequence and has no dependencies on other sequences within this phase.
- Depends on all four prior festivals (chain-agents, dashboard, hedera-foundation, hiero-plugin) being complete.

### Provides (to other sequences)

- **E2E Validation**: Confirms the system works, enabling all subsequent packaging sequences to document a working system
- **Profitability Data**: Used by 05_base_package for the P&L proof document
- **Test Logs**: Referenced by demo notes and architecture documentation

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Testnet instability during testing | Medium | High | Retry tests, document network conditions, have backup testnet accounts |
| Agent crash with no recovery | Low | High | Fix the crash before proceeding, document as known limitation if unfixable in time |
| DeFi agent shows net loss | Medium | High | Adjust trading parameters, run more cycles, document profitability path even if marginal |

## Progress Tracking

### Milestones

- [ ] **Milestone 1**: Project linked, all three agents started and communicating
- [ ] **Milestone 2**: Full economy cycle completed successfully at least once
- [ ] **Milestone 3**: Failure recovery tested, profitability validated, all quality gates passed

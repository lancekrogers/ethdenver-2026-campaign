# Task: Failure Recovery Testing

**Task Number:** 03 | **Sequence:** 01_e2e_testing | **Autonomy:** medium

## Objective

Test failure recovery scenarios to verify the system handles adverse conditions gracefully. Test agent crashes mid-task, failed HCS message delivery, failed HTS transfers, and network timeouts. Document the recovery behavior for each scenario.

## Requirements

- [ ] Agent crash mid-task tested and recovery documented
- [ ] Failed HCS message delivery tested and recovery documented
- [ ] Failed HTS transfer tested and recovery documented
- [ ] Network timeout tested and recovery documented
- [ ] Results saved to `results/failure_recovery_report.md` within this sequence directory

## Implementation

### Scenario 1: Agent Crash Mid-Task

**Setup:** Start all three agents. Trigger an economy cycle. While the inference agent is processing a task, kill the inference agent process.

**Steps:**

1. Start all three agents and verify they are communicating
2. Trigger an economy cycle (task assignment to inference agent)
3. While the inference agent is processing, kill its process: `kill -9 <pid>`
4. Observe the coordinator's behavior:
   - Does the coordinator detect the agent is gone (heartbeat timeout)?
   - Does the coordinator reassign the task or mark it as failed?
   - How long until detection?
5. Restart the inference agent
6. Observe whether the system recovers:
   - Does the inference agent re-register?
   - Does the coordinator retry the failed task?
   - Does the system reach a consistent state?

**Document:** Detection time, recovery steps (automatic vs manual), final system state.

### Scenario 2: Failed HCS Message Delivery

**Setup:** Simulate a failed HCS message by testing with invalid topic IDs or by temporarily exhausting the testnet account's HBAR balance.

**Steps:**

1. Start all agents normally
2. Introduce a message delivery failure condition (e.g., set an invalid topic ID for one agent's outbound messages, or drain the testnet account to cause transaction failures)
3. Trigger an economy cycle
4. Observe behavior:
   - Does the sender detect the failure?
   - Are there retry attempts?
   - Does the system log clear error messages?
   - Does the system degrade gracefully or crash?
5. Restore normal conditions
6. Verify the system recovers

**Document:** Error messages, retry behavior, degradation mode, recovery steps.

### Scenario 3: Failed HTS Transfer

**Setup:** Simulate a failed HTS token transfer by attempting a transfer with insufficient balance or to an unassociated account.

**Steps:**

1. Start all agents, run a cycle to the payment settlement stage
2. Before the HTS transfer, modify conditions to cause failure (e.g., ensure the paying account has insufficient token balance)
3. Observe the payment settlement behavior:
   - Does the system detect the failed transfer?
   - Does it retry with backoff?
   - Does it report the failure clearly?
   - Does the rest of the system continue operating?
4. Fix the balance issue
5. Verify payment eventually succeeds (or is properly marked as failed)

**Document:** Error handling, retry logic, state consistency after failure.

### Scenario 4: Network Timeout

**Setup:** Simulate network instability by introducing artificial latency or temporarily blocking network access to one agent.

**Steps:**

1. Start all agents normally
2. Introduce a network delay or block for one agent (e.g., using a firewall rule or by pausing the process with SIGSTOP)
3. Observe the system's behavior over 30-60 seconds:
   - Do other agents continue operating?
   - Does the coordinator detect the unresponsive agent?
   - Are HCS subscriptions resilient to temporary disconnects?
4. Remove the network block
5. Observe recovery:
   - Does the agent reconnect?
   - Are missed HCS messages replayed?
   - Does the system reach a consistent state?

**Document:** Timeout detection, subscription resilience, reconnection behavior, message replay.

### Step 5: Write the failure recovery report

Create `results/failure_recovery_report.md` with a section for each scenario containing: test setup, steps taken, observed behavior, recovery outcome, and any bugs discovered.

## Done When

- [ ] All four failure scenarios tested
- [ ] Recovery behavior documented for each scenario
- [ ] Any critical bugs discovered are documented with reproduction steps
- [ ] Report saved to `results/failure_recovery_report.md`
- [ ] If any scenario reveals a critical bug, it is flagged for immediate attention

# Sequence Goal: 02_hedera_track3_package

**Sequence:** 02_hedera_track3_package | **Phase:** 003_EXECUTE | **Status:** Pending | **Created:** 2026-02-18T14:00:00-07:00

## Sequence Objective

**Primary Goal:** Polish the agent-coordinator README, write detailed architecture documentation, and prepare demo notes for the Hedera Track 3 ($5k) bounty submission.

**Contribution to Phase Goal:** This sequence produces the documentation package for Hedera Track 3, which requires demonstrating native Hedera service usage (HCS messaging, HTS payments) in the agent-coordinator project. The README, architecture doc, and demo notes are the primary materials judges will review.

## Success Criteria

The sequence goal is achieved when:

### Required Deliverables

- [ ] **Polished README.md**: agent-coordinator README with project overview, architecture diagram, setup instructions, demo walkthrough, and bounty alignment section
- [ ] **Architecture Document**: `docs/architecture.md` with HCS messaging flow, HTS payment cycle, coordinator state machine, and agent communication protocol
- [ ] **Demo Notes**: `docs/demo-notes.md` with the Hedera Track 3 demo script, talking points, and key highlights

### Quality Standards

- [ ] README follows a consistent structure with clear sections
- [ ] Architecture diagram is present (ASCII or Mermaid format)
- [ ] All setup instructions are tested and reproducible
- [ ] Bounty alignment section explicitly maps features to Hedera Track 3 requirements
- [ ] No broken links in any document

### Completion Criteria

- [ ] All tasks in sequence completed successfully
- [ ] Quality verification tasks passed
- [ ] Code review completed and issues addressed

## Task Alignment

| Task | Task Objective | Contribution to Sequence Goal |
|------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| 01_polish_readme.md | Polish agent-coordinator README | Primary submission document for judges |
| 02_architecture_doc.md | Write detailed architecture documentation | Technical depth document for evaluation |
| 03_demo_notes.md | Write demo notes for Hedera Track 3 | Structured talking points for the demo |
| 04_testing_and_verify.md | Quality gate: testing | Verifies documentation quality and link validity |
| 05_code_review.md | Quality gate: code review | Reviews documentation for clarity and completeness |
| 06_review_results_iterate.md | Quality gate: iterate | Addresses findings and confirms readiness |

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites (from other sequences)

- 01_e2e_testing: Provides validated test logs and system behavior data that the architecture doc and demo notes reference

### Provides (to other sequences)

- **README and Architecture Docs**: Referenced by 07_deploy for deployment verification and 08_demo_video for demo script content

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Architecture diagram complexity | Low | Medium | Use Mermaid for maintainability, keep to essential flows |
| Bounty requirements misalignment | Low | High | Cross-reference ETHDenver submission portal requirements directly |

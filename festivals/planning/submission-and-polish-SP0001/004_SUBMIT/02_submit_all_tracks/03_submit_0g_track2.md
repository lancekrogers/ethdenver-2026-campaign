# Task: Submit 0G Track 2 Bounty

**Task Number:** 03 | **Sequence:** 02_submit_all_tracks | **Autonomy:** low

## Objective

Submit the 0G Track 2 ($7k) bounty on the ETHDenver submission portal. Fill out the submission form with: inference agent repo, compute metrics document, and demo video.

## Requirements

- [ ] Submission form accessed on the ETHDenver portal
- [ ] All required fields filled completely
- [ ] Inference agent repo URL and compute metrics included
- [ ] Submission confirmed
- [ ] Confirmation recorded

## Implementation

### Step 1: Gather submission materials

| Material | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Repository URL | https://github.com/[org]/agent-inference |
| Compute Metrics URL | [direct link to docs/compute-metrics.md] |
| Demo Video URL | [YouTube URL] |
| README URL | [direct link to README.md] |
| Dashboard URL | [deployed dashboard URL] |

### Step 2: Prepare description text

**Project Name**: [agent-inference project name]

**Short Description**: An AI inference agent that executes model inference on decentralized GPUs via 0G Compute, producing verifiable results as part of a multi-agent economy.

**Detailed Description**: Describe the inference pipeline, 0G Compute integration, performance metrics, and how decentralized GPU inference provides value (censorship resistance, cost efficiency, no vendor lock-in).

**Bounty Alignment**: State how this meets 0G Track 2 requirements for decentralized GPU inference. Reference the compute metrics document for hard evidence of GPU usage, latency, and throughput.

### Step 3: Fill out the submission form

1. **Project Name**: Enter the project name
2. **Repository URL**: Paste repo URL
3. **Description**: Paste prepared description
4. **Bounty Track**: Select 0G Track 2
5. **Additional Links**: Add compute metrics, README, demo video, dashboard

### Step 4: Review and submit

- [ ] Re-read every field for typos
- [ ] Verify every link opens correctly
- [ ] Confirm correct bounty track selected
- [ ] Submit and record confirmation

## Done When

- [ ] Submission form completed

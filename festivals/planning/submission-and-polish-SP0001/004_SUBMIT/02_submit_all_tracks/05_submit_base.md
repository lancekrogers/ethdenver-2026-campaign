# Task: Submit Base Bounty

**Task Number:** 05 | **Sequence:** 02_submit_all_tracks | **Autonomy:** low

## Objective

Submit the Base ($3k+) bounty on the ETHDenver submission portal. Fill out the submission form with: DeFi agent repo, P&L proof document, and ERC standard integration documentation.

## Requirements

- [ ] Submission form accessed on the ETHDenver portal
- [ ] All required fields filled completely
- [ ] P&L proof document and ERC standard integrations included
- [ ] Submission confirmed
- [ ] Confirmation recorded

## Implementation

### Step 1: Gather submission materials

| Material | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Repository URL | https://github.com/[org]/agent-defi |
| P&L Proof URL | [direct link to docs/pnl-proof.md] |
| README URL | [direct link to README.md] |
| Demo Video URL | [YouTube URL] |
| Agent Address | [DeFi agent's on-chain address] |
| ERC-8004 Identity | [on-chain identity reference] |
| Dashboard URL | [deployed dashboard URL] |

### Step 2: Prepare description text

**Project Name**: [agent-defi project name]

**Short Description**: A self-sustaining DeFi trading agent on Base that generates revenue exceeding its operational costs, with on-chain identity (ERC-8004), payment protocol (x402), and attribution (ERC-8021).

**Detailed Description**: Describe the self-sustaining model: the agent autonomously trades, generates revenue from spreads, and pays for its own gas and service costs. Reference the P&L proof document with transaction hashes judges can verify. Mention ERC standard integrations for identity, payments, and attribution.

**Bounty Alignment**: State how this meets Base bounty requirements for a self-sustaining agent. The P&L proof document provides irrefutable evidence of profitability with on-chain transaction hashes. ERC-8004 provides identity, x402 enables machine-to-machine payments, and ERC-8021 creates an attribution trail.

### Step 3: Fill out the submission form

1. **Project Name**: Enter the project name
2. **Repository URL**: Paste repo URL
3. **Description**: Paste prepared description
4. **Bounty Track**: Select Base
5. **Additional Links**: Add P&L proof, README, demo video, dashboard, agent address on block explorer

### Step 4: Review and submit

- [ ] Re-read every field for typos
- [ ] Verify every link opens correctly
- [ ] Verify P&L proof is accessible and transaction hashes resolve on block explorer
- [ ] Confirm correct bounty track selected
- [ ] Submit and record confirmation

## Done When

- [ ] Submission form completed
- [ ] All links verified including P&L proof and on-chain references
- [ ] Submission confirmed
- [ ] Confirmation recorded

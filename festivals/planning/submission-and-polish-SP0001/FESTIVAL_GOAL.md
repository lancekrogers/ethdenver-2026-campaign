# Submission and Polish

**Status:** Planned | **Created:** 2026-02-18T13:41:01-07:00

## Festival Objective

**Primary Goal:** Get the three-agent autonomous economy running end-to-end and record a demo video.

**Vision:** All three agents operate across Hedera, 0G, and Base — communicating via HCS, settling payments via HTS — with a working dashboard or visualization, captured in a demo video. Submission deadline has passed; this is about making the system work and proving it on camera.

## Success Criteria

### Must Have

- [ ] Full economy cycle runs end-to-end on testnet (coordinator assigns, agents execute, payment settles)
- [ ] Dashboard or visualization shows agent activity in real-time
- [ ] Demo video recorded (under 3 minutes)
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in agent code

### Should Have

- [ ] 0G inference pipeline executes against real compute
- [ ] DeFi agent executes real trades on Base Sepolia
- [ ] P&L proof with real trade data

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Polished project READMEs
- [ ] Architecture diagrams

## Progress Tracking

### Phase Completion

- [x] 001_INGEST: Gather all artifacts and assess project state
- [ ] 002_PLAN: Define what needs to be fixed/built to get the demo working
- [ ] 003_EXECUTE: Fix dashboard, resolve blockers, run E2E, record demo
- [ ] 004_SUBMIT: Final review and cleanup

## Complete When

- [ ] All phases completed
- [ ] Three-agent economy runs end-to-end on testnet
- [ ] Demo video recorded and reviewed
- [ ] No known critical issues remaining

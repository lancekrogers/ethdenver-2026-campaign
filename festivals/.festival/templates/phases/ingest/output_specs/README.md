# Output Specifications

Structured output from the ingest phase will be created here.

## Expected Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `purpose.md` | Festival purpose, success criteria, motivation |
| `requirements.md` | Prioritized requirements (P0/P1/P2) with traceability |
| `constraints.md` | Technical and process constraints |
| `context.md` | Prior art, related systems, key references |

## Quality Standards

- Requirements should be traceable to input sources
- Constraints should explain "why" not just "what"
- All documents require user approval before phase completion

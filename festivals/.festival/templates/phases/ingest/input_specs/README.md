# Input Specifications

Place all raw input materials here for the agent to process.

## What to Include

- User requirements (any format)
- Reference documents
- Examples or prior art
- Constraints and guidelines
- Any context the agent needs

## Guidelines

- Files can be any format (markdown, text, images, PDFs)
- Include everything relevant — the agent will sort through it
- Don't pre-structure — that's what the ingest phase does
- More context is better than less

## Processing

The agent will:
1. Read all files in this directory
2. Extract key information
3. Structure it into `output_specs/`
4. Present for your approval

# Implementation Plan

Create `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` here with the detailed plan structure.

## Plan Structure

1. **Overview** — What will be implemented
2. **Phases** — Implementation phases with goals
3. **Sequences** — Sequences within each phase
4. **Tasks** — Tasks within each sequence
5. **Dependencies** — What blocks what

## Plan Template

Create `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan

## Overview

[Brief description of what will be implemented]

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]

**Type:** implementation | planning | research | review
**Goal:** [What this phase accomplishes]

## Hierarchy

- **Festival:** [Name]
  - **Phase 1:** [Name] (type)
    - Sequence A: [Name]
      - Task 1
      - Task 2
    - Sequence B: [Name]

# Task: Code Review

**Task Number:** <no value> | **Parallel Group:** None | **Dependencies:** Testing and Verification | **Autonomy:** low

## Objective

Review the sequence against the runtime design and record concrete findings with file paths, rerun commands, and approval status.

## Required Inputs

- The sequence goal for the current sequence
- The list of modified files
- The exact commands run in the testing gate and their results
- Any runtime logs, run IDs, session IDs, or artifact paths produced by the sequence

## Review Checklist

### Architecture Checks

- [ ] Changes still use the real `fest` CLI rather than reimplementing fest logic.
- [ ] Changes still use the real `obey` daemon runtime rather than a deterministic local shortcut.
- [ ] Ritual source of truth remains in the campaign root.
- [ ] Fail-closed behavior exists for missing binaries, missing artifacts, and session failures.

### Code and Process Checks

- [ ] Modified files are the minimum necessary set for the sequence.
- [ ] New interfaces and structs are named clearly.
- [ ] Errors are wrapped or logged clearly enough to debug runtime failures.
- [ ] Testing evidence actually covers the main failure modes of the sequence.

## Findings Format

Write findings directly in this file using this exact structure:

- `Critical`: file path + concrete problem + required fix
- `Major`: file path + concrete problem + required fix
- `Minor`: file path + concrete problem + suggested fix
- `No findings`: only if you can explicitly justify why the sequence is safe

## Required Review Output

- [ ] List every modified file reviewed
- [ ] Re-run the key verification commands from the testing gate
- [ ] Record whether the sequence is Approved or Needs Changes
- [ ] If Needs Changes, include a blocking fix list that the iterate gate must address

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Modified files reviewed
- [ ] Verification commands re-run
- [ ] Findings recorded in concrete terms or `No findings` stated explicitly
- [ ] Verdict recorded as Approved or Needs Changes

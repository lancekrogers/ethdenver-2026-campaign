# Festival Planning

Festivals are structured project plans with a 3-level hierarchy: Phases > Sequences > Tasks. The fest CLI manages their creation, validation, and lifecycle.

## First Step: Learn the Methodology

Before creating anything, run:

```bash
fest understand methodology    # Core principles
fest understand structure      # 3-level hierarchy explained
fest understand tasks          # When and how to create task files
fest understand rules          # Naming conventions (required for automation)
fest understand checklist      # Quick validation checklist
```

See [references/understand-topics.md](references/understand-topics.md) for the full topic index.

## Shell Setup

Enable the `fgo` navigation function:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
eval "$(fest shell-init zsh)"    # or bash/fish
```

`fgo` toggles between the festival directory and its linked project directory. `fgo <name>` jumps to a specific festival.

## Creating Festivals

### Interactive Creation (TUI)

```bash
fest create festival             # Create a new festival
fest create phase                # Add a phase to current festival
fest create sequence             # Add a sequence to current phase
fest create task                 # Add a task to current sequence
```

### Scaffolding from Type

```bash
fest types                       # Discover available types
fest scaffold                    # Auto-generate structure based on type
```

### Naming Conventions

Festivals follow strict naming rules for automation:

- Phases: `NNN_PHASE_NAME/` (e.g., `001_IMPLEMENT/`)
- Sequences: `NN_sequence_name/` (e.g., `01_auth_module/`)
- Tasks: `NN_task_description.md` (e.g., `01_create_auth_handler.md`)

Run `fest rules` to see the full naming rules for the current festival.

## Linking Festivals to Projects

Connect a festival to its working directory:

```bash
fest link                        # Link current festival to a project (interactive)
fest link --project projects/camp    # Link to specific project
fest links                       # List all active links
fest unlink                      # Remove link
```

Links enable:
- `fgo` toggling between festival and project
- `fest context` to show both festival and project state
- `fest commit` to create commits with festival references

## Navigation

```bash
fgo                              # Toggle between festival and linked project
fgo my-festival                  # Jump to a specific festival
fest go                          # Navigate to festivals root
fest go <location>               # Navigate to specific phase/sequence
```

## Festival Lifecycle

Festivals progress through statuses:

```
planning → ready → active → completed
                      ↘ archived
                      ↘ someday
```

```bash
fest promote                     # Move festival to next lifecycle status
fest list                        # List festivals by status
fest list --status active        # Filter by status
```

## Review and Validate

Review festival structure and validate before execution:

```bash
fest show --roadmap              # Full execution roadmap with task statuses
fest show --inprogress           # Focus on in-progress work only
fest show --goals                # Show goals for phases and sequences
fest validate                    # Check structure compliance
fest validate --fix              # Auto-fix common issues
```

## Common Mistakes

- Not running `fest understand` first - leads to wrong structure and naming
- Wrong naming conventions - automation depends on the `NNN_` and `NN_` prefixes
- Creating tasks without sequence goals - every sequence needs a SEQUENCE_GOAL.md
- Forgetting to link festival to project - `fgo` toggle won't work
- Skipping validation - `fest validate` catches issues early

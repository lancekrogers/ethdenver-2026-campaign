# Campaign Navigation

Camp provides fast navigation across multi-project workspaces through shell functions, shortcuts, and fuzzy finding.

## Shell Setup

The `cgo` shell function requires shell initialization:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
eval "$(camp shell-init zsh)"    # or bash/fish
```

Without this, `cgo` won't be available. `camp go` works without shell init but cannot change your shell's working directory.

## cgo - Primary Navigation

`cgo` is a shell function that changes your working directory using campaign concepts and shortcuts.

```bash
cgo                   # Navigate to campaign root
cgo p                 # Navigate to projects/
cgo f                 # Navigate to festivals/
cgo i                 # Navigate to workflow/intents/
cgo w                 # Navigate to workflow/
cgo <shortcut>        # Navigate to any configured shortcut
cgo p camp            # Navigate to projects/camp/ (concept + item)
cgo p fest            # Navigate to projects/festival/
```

### Standard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Target | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `p` | `projects/` | Project submodules |
| `f` | `festivals/` | Festival planning |
| `i` | `workflow/intents/` | Ideas and future work |
| `w` | `workflow/` | Work management |
| `wt` | `projects/worktrees/` | Git worktrees |
| `a` | `ai_docs/` | AI-generated docs |
| `d` | `docs/` | Human documentation |
| `du` | `dungeon/` | Archived work |
| `cr` | `workflow/code_reviews/` | Code reviews |
| `de` | `workflow/design/` | Design documents |
| `pi` | `workflow/pipelines/` | CI/CD pipelines |

### Concept Drilling

Some shortcuts support drilling into subdirectories:

```bash
cgo p                 # Lists projects, fuzzy-find to pick one
cgo f                 # Lists festivals at any depth
cgo w                 # Lists workflow subdirectories (1 level deep)
```

Depth is configurable per concept in `.campaign/campaign.yaml`.

## camp go - Programmatic Navigation

`camp go` outputs the target path without changing directory. Useful in scripts or when `cgo` isn't available:

```bash
camp go p             # Prints absolute path to projects/
camp go f             # Prints absolute path to festivals/
```

## Shell Completions

```bash
camp completion zsh > ~/.zfunc/_camp    # Generate completions
```

## Common Mistakes

- Using raw `cd projects/camp` instead of `cgo p camp` - works but doesn't track navigation
- Forgetting `eval "$(camp shell-init zsh)"` in shell config - `cgo` won't exist
- Using `camp go` expecting it to change directory - it only prints the path; use `cgo` instead

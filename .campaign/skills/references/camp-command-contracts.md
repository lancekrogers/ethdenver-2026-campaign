# Camp Command Contracts

Verified against `camp dev` (`5999d08`, built 2026-03-03).

## Navigation

```bash
cgo <shortcut>
camp go <shortcut> --print
```

`cgo` changes shell directory. `camp go` resolves/prints paths.

## Submodule Commits

```bash
camp p commit -m "message"
```

This commits in the submodule. Campaign-root pointer sync is a separate intentional action:

```bash
camp refs-sync
camp refs-sync projects/camp
```

## Status Scope

```bash
camp status           # campaign root
camp status --sub     # current submodule
camp status all       # cross-project status
```

## Pull/Push Scope

```bash
camp pull             # campaign root
camp pull --sub       # current submodule
camp pull all         # all repos

camp push             # campaign root
camp push --sub       # current submodule
camp push all         # all repos with pending pushes
```

## Worktrees

```bash
camp project worktree add <name> [--project <name>] [--branch <branch>]
camp project worktree list [--project <name>]
camp project worktree remove <name> [--project <name>]
```

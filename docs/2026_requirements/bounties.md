## Hedera

**Total: $25,000 across 4 tracks**

> Transcript listed as "Hideira". Hedera DevDay: Feb 17, 2026 (day before on-site hackathon).

### Track 1: Killer App for the Agentic Society — $10,000

**Winners:** 1

**What they want:** An agent-native application built for a society of OpenClaw agents where commerce, coordination, or value exchange happens autonomously. The app must prioritize agents as primary users, not humans using agents as tools.

**Requirements:**
- Build on OpenClaw runtime (Node.js agent framework, 60k+ GitHub stars)
- Demonstrate autonomous or semi-autonomous agent behavior
- Create clear value in multi-agent environments
- Use Hedera EVM, Token Service (HTS), or Consensus Service (HCS)
- UI designed for humans *observing* agents — the product is not human-operated
- Interface must show agent flow steps and states

**Bonus:** Use UCP (Universal Commerce Protocol) to standardize agent-to-agent commerce.

**Key tech:**
- OpenClaw: local agent runtime bridging LLMs to 50+ integrations
- Hedera Agent Kit JS (`npm install hedera-agent-kit`) — LangChain, Vercel AI, ElizaOS, MCP Server integrations
- UCP: Google's open standard for agentic commerce (REST/JSON-RPC, A2A, MCP support)

### Track 2: On-Chain Automation — $5,000

**Winners:** 2 ($3,000 + $2,000)

**What they want:** Applications that use Hedera's protocol-level smart contract automation (HIP-1215). Smart contracts scheduling their own future executions — on-chain cron jobs with no off-chain keepers.

**Requirements:**
- Working testnet app creating and executing scheduled transactions
- Scheduling must initiate FROM smart contracts (not external triggers)
- Focus on DeFi automation or business finance flows
- Include edge case handling and observability

**Key tech:**
- HIP-1215: Generalized Scheduled Contract Calls — contracts schedule any contract call via Hedera Schedule Service
- HIP-755: Schedule Service System Contract — EVM access to native scheduling
- `hasScheduleCapacity(uint256 expiry, uint256 gasLimit)` view function for finding available execution windows
- Use cases: DeFi liquidations, token vesting, vault health monitoring, DAO treasury actions

### Track 3: "No Solidity Allowed" — $5,000

**Winners:** 3 ($2,500 / $1,500 / $1,000)

**What they want:** Applications built entirely with Hedera's native SDKs — zero Solidity, zero EVM contracts.

**Requirements:**
- Must use at least TWO native Hedera capabilities (e.g., HTS + HCS)
- Zero Solidity or EVM contracts allowed
- Working testnet app
- Clear security model with proper key handling

**Available SDKs:** JavaScript/TypeScript (`@hashgraph/sdk`), Java, Go, Python (`hedera-sdk-py`), Rust, C

**Native services (no Solidity needed):**
- Hedera Token Service (HTS): create/manage tokens at protocol level
- Hedera Consensus Service (HCS): timestamped, ordered message logs
- Hedera File Service: decentralized file storage
- Hedera Schedule Service: transaction scheduling
- Account management: native account creation, key rotation, multi-sig

### Track 4: Best Hiero CLI Plugin — $5,000

**Winners:** 2 ($2,500 each)

**What they want:** A plugin for the Hiero CLI (formerly Hedera CLI, now under Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust).

**Requirements:**
- Submit a PR to the [hiero-cli repo](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-cli)
- Follow existing Node.js plugin architecture (see `PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`)
- Must be useful beyond the hackathon
- Include PR link, demo video, usage documentation

**Judging criteria:** Developer value, code quality, architecture fit, usability, lasting impact.

## 0G Labs

**Total: $25,000 across 4 tracks**

### Track 1: Best DeFAI Application — $7,000

**Winners:** 2 ($5,000 + $2,000)

**What they want:** A functional DeFi product (swap, lend, borrow, stake, LP, vault) where AI materially enhances the workflow — not merely a conversational chatbot.

**Requirements:**
- AI must deliver structured decisions and automation while maintaining user control
- Safety measures: confirmations, limits, explainability, simulation
- End-to-end demonstration scenario
- Risk explanations justifying AI recommendations

### Track 2: Best Use of AI Inference or Fine-Tuning — $7,000

**Winners:** 2

**What they want:** Projects that leverage 0G Compute for decentralized AI inference or fine-tuning.

**Key tech:**
- 0G Compute: decentralized GPU marketplace with broker-based provider matching
- Fine-Tuning CLI: full lifecycle — upload dataset to 0G Storage, submit training job, monitor, download model
- Provider runs in Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) with TEE attestation
- Escrow-based payment: funds release after customer acknowledges delivery
- TypeScript SDK: `@0glabs/0g-serving-broker`

### Track 3: Best Use of On-Chain Agent (iNFT) — $7,000

**Winners:** 2

**What they want:** Projects using ERC-7857 Intelligent NFTs — AI agents tokenized as NFTs with encrypted, dynamic metadata.

**Key tech:**
- ERC-7857: 0G's custom NFT standard for AI agents
- iNFT metadata = agent's "intelligence" (model weights, memory, behavior)
- Encrypted metadata transferred via TEE oracle during sales
- Dynamic metadata updates as agents learn
- Docs: `docs.0g.ai/build-with-0g/inft`

### Track 4: Best Developer Tooling or Education — $4,000

**Winners:** 1

**What they want:** Tools that improve the 0G developer experience or educational resources.

### 0G Developer Resources

| Layer | SDK/Tool |
|-------|---------|
| **Storage** | Go: `github.com/0gfoundation/0g-storage-client` / TS: `@0glabs/0g-ts-sdk` |
| **Compute** | TS: `@0glabs/0g-serving-broker` / Starter: `0g-compute-ts-starter-kit` |

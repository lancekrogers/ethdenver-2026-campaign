# Worktrees

Git worktrees for parallel development across projects.

## What Goes Here

- Git worktrees for feature branches
- Organized by project name, then branch name
- Created automatically via camp worktree commands

## Structure

```
worktrees/
├── api-service/
│   ├── feature-auth/
│   └── bugfix-logging/
└── frontend/
    └── redesign-2024/
```

## Usage

```bash
# Create a worktree for a project branch
camp worktree create api-service feature-auth

# List all worktrees
camp worktree list

# Remove a worktree
camp worktree remove api-service feature-auth
```

# Dungeon

Archived, deprioritized, or paused work.

## What Goes Here

- Paused or abandoned projects
- Deprioritized features and ideas
- Historical reference material
- Work that may be revisited later

## Structure

```
dungeon/
└── archived/           # Long-term archived content
```

## Guidelines

- Move items here rather than deleting them
- Add notes explaining why work was paused
- Review periodically for potential revival
